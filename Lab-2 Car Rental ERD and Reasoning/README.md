## INFSCI 1022 – Database Systems 
In-class Lab 2 – Building Relational Models


Car Rental Database

Design a relational database for a car rental reservation system (similar to enterpise.com).  At the very least, this database should support data related to the system’s users, vehicles available, vehicles rented, rental office locations and travel destinations.  Identify all entities and their attributes, determine or create primary keys for each table, identify appropriate foreign keys and define relationships between tables (1:1, 1:m, or m:n).  

Create a database schema diagram (E-R Model) using MySQL Workbench and present it to the class.  Submit the .mbw file. Be prepared to explain your design decisions.
