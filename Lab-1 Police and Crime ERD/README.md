## INFSCI 1022 – Database Systems – Spring 2017
In-class Lab 1 – Building Relational Models

Crime Reporting Database

Design a relational database for a crime reporting system.  At the very least, this database should support data related to:
•	The system’s users
•	Reported crimes
•	Crime locations
•	Responding police offices
Identify all entities and their attributes, determine or create primary keys for each table, identify appropriate foreign keys and define relationships between tables (1:1, 1:m, or m:n).  Create a database schema diagram (E-R Model) using draw.io tool.  Be prepared to explain your design decisions.

To setup draw.io:
1.	If you don’t have a Gmail account, register for one
2.	Go to drive.google.com and login using your Gmail credentials
3.	Click on New → More → Connect more apps…
 
4.	In the search field, search for “draw.io”
5.	Click “Connect” button next to “draw.io” search result
6.	Draw.io will appear in your connected Google Drive apps
7.	To launch a new Draw.io diagram, click New → More → draw.io Diagrams

To submit your lab assignment:
1.	With your draw.io assignment open, click the blue “Share” button in the top right corner
2.	Click “Get shareable link”
3.	Change sharing settings to “Anyone with the link can edit”
 
4.	Copy the share link and submit it via CourseWeb
